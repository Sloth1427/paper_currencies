I wondered whether it was possible to estimate the total cost of publishing in different journals, so I collected 10 years of US RO1 grant data, and analysed the publication list of thousands of PIs using multiple linear regression. 

The Prism files have some results. See estimate_cost_per_paper_vs_IF.pdf for the main graph. Interestingly the big reviews cost most, probably because even though they don't take research money, it's only big labs that get asked to right for the big review journals?
